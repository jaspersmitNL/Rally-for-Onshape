## Features

- Floating pen sidebar with quick-access Onshape toolbar commands
- Dynamic toolbar buttons driven by Onshape shortcut configuration
- Draggable sidebar with persistent position using local storage
- Floating numeric keypad for precise numeric input inside Onshape
- Dark theme integration and icon sprite injection for a native feel

## Technology

- React + TypeScript
- Vite
